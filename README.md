## Database

I am using Postgres to store data, you can use [DBngin](https://dbngin.com/) to start a Postgres instance, it will download binaries and start a database in your local env, I set everything as postgres during database creation in DBngin, you should not have problems with connection.

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ yarn run start

# watch mode
$ yarn run start:dev

# production mode
$ yarn run start:prod
```
